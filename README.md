# POPL-Parser-Project
Parser Project for Principles of Programming Languages

ANTLR Lab: http://lab.antlr.org/
Video Tutorial: https://www.loom.com/share/422fbf8474134cf4af08f107aec2869a

GOAL: In this project, we use the ANTLR grammar to develop a simple version of the Python language.

Team Members: Kenzie Mcallister, Jessica Xie, Sophia Martin, Gabriella Ramirez

To set up our project, open the ANTLR Lab (link provided at the top of the README) in a separate tab. Start by deleting all of the content within the lexer and parser and changing the language to Python. Next, copy the text from the deliverable3_lexer.g4 file and paste that into "Lexer". For the "Parser", copy and paste the text from the deliverable3_parser.g4 file and paste it in. In the input, put in your python code of choice (to test the language). Change the start rule text to "start". Then you can hit the "Run" button to see our code in action.
